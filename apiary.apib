# Predictive Emotion Service

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already part of our lives. Whenever you pick up
your smartphone, youâ€™re already seeing what AI can do for you, from tailored 
recommendations to relevant search results. With the Salesforce Predictive 
Emotion Service, you can build AI into your Salesforce org or apps without 
needing a Stanford PhD.

The Predictive Emotion Service is part of the Einstein suite of technologies, 
and you can use it to AI-enable your apps. The Predictive Emotion Service takes 
data from heartbeats of a person, learns about how those correlate with that 
person's emotive state, and predicts whether the person is happy, sad, angry, 
or excited to an 87% accuracy.

You can use the service to ascertain mood data from heartbeat data. It analyzes 
small variations in heartbeat intervals to determine levels of emotion.

Out of the box, Predictive Emotion Service already provides datasets for anger,
sadness, excitement, and happiness. More can be added by uploading heartbeat
datasets and labeling with emotions.

## Dataset Collection [/v1/datasets]

Datasets contain heartbeat data associated with an emotion label and a time.

## Heartbeats [/v1/heartbeats]

Hearbeats are the data used for mood prediction. They are composed of two
timestamps, the heartbeat's beginning, and its finish times.

These two timestamps are used to calculate a heartbeats' wavelength, frequency,
and intervals. The variations in the intervals are used to predict emotion.

### Create Hearbeats [POST]

Add one more many hearbeats. These are automatically attached to a dataset
according to the timestamp.

+ Request (application/json)

## Emotions [/v1/emotions]

Emotions are labels for datasets. "sad", "happy", "angry", "excited" are
pre-trained datasets already included with Predictive Emotion Service. More
emotions can be added, and data can also be added to the 4 existing datasets.

Best practices on emotion naming: emotions should be named "I am feeling ...".

### Create an emotion [POST]

Creates a new emotion.

            {
                "emotion": "surprise"
            }


+ Response 204

+ Response 400

            {
            }

### Get Emotions [GET]

Gets a list of emotions.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

## Corrections [/v1/correct]

A prediction that is made on a dataset returns an emotion. If the prediction
is incorrect, it can be amended using this endpoint

### Correct a Prediction [POST]

Corrects a prediction.

If the emotion that is passed already exists, then the relevant dataset is
labeled with the corrected emotion. If the emotion that is passed does not
exist yet, a new dataset is created labeled with the new emotion.
